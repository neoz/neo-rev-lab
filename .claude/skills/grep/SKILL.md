`grep` is IDASQL's entity-search surface. Use it to discover named functions, labels, segments, structs, enums, and members before pivoting into xrefs, decompiler, or type work.

---

## Trigger Intents

Use this skill when user asks to:
- find functions, labels, types, or members by name
- search by prefix/substring like `sub_`, `EH`, `Zw`, `CreateFile`, or `main`
- page through search results quickly
- decide whether to use the `grep` table or `grep()` JSON output

Route to:
- `xrefs` after locating a candidate callee/import/function and needing callers/callees/references
- `decompiler` after choosing a candidate function to inspect semantically
- `types` when the hit is a struct/enum/member you need to inspect or edit

---

## Do This First (Quick Start)

```sql
-- 1) Start with a structured search while you learn the result shape
SELECT name, kind, address
FROM grep
WHERE pattern = 'main'
ORDER BY kind, name
LIMIT 20;
```

```sql
-- 2) Narrow immediately when the result set is noisy
SELECT name, ordinal, full_name
FROM grep
WHERE pattern = 'EH%' AND kind = 'struct'
ORDER BY name;
```

```sql
-- 3) Use JSON when you want a quick paged payload
SELECT grep('sub_%', 10, 0);
SELECT grep('sub_%', 10, 10);
```

Interpretation guidance:
- Prefer the `grep` table first when you want to filter, sort, join, or group.
- Prefer `grep()` when you want one JSON cell for quick paging or downstream parsing.

---

## Pick a Surface

Use `grep` table when you need:
- `WHERE kind = ...`
- `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY`, `JOIN`
- richer follow-on SQL after discovery

Use `grep()` when you need:
- quick JSON output
- pagination without writing a full row query
- `json_each(...)` parsing inside one statement

`grep()` accepts `grep(pattern [, limit [, offset]])`.
Defaults:
- `limit = 50`
- `offset = 0`

Both surfaces expose the same entity fields:
- `name`
- `kind`
- `address`
- `ordinal`
- `parent_name`
- `full_name`

Common `kind` values:
- `function`
- `label`
- `segment`
- `struct`
- `union`
- `enum`
- `member`
- `enum_member`

---

## Pattern Rules

- Matching is case-insensitive.
- Plain text becomes a contains-match.
- `%` matches any substring.
- `_` matches a single character.
- `*` is accepted and normalized to `%`.
- Empty pattern returns no rows from `grep` and `[]` from `grep()`.
- This is not regex.
- This is unrelated to `search_bytes()`.

Examples:

```sql
-- Contains-match
SELECT name, kind
FROM grep
WHERE pattern = 'main'
LIMIT 20;
```

```sql
-- Prefix wildcard
SELECT name, kind, address
FROM grep
WHERE pattern = 'sub_%'
ORDER BY name
LIMIT 20;
```

```sql
-- Shell-style star is accepted too
SELECT name, kind
FROM grep
WHERE pattern = 'Zw*'
LIMIT 20;
```

## Common Workflows

### Find candidate functions by name

```sql
SELECT name, address
FROM grep
WHERE pattern = 'main%' AND kind = 'function'
ORDER BY name;
```

### Resolve imported APIs

```sql
SELECT module, name, address
FROM imports
WHERE name LIKE 'CreateFile%'
ORDER BY module, name;
```

### Find types by convention

```sql
SELECT name, kind, ordinal, full_name
FROM grep
WHERE pattern = 'EH%' AND kind IN ('struct', 'enum')
ORDER BY kind, name;
```

### Find members under a parent type

```sql
SELECT name, parent_name, ordinal
FROM grep
WHERE pattern = 'flag%' AND kind = 'member'
ORDER BY parent_name, name
LIMIT 30;
```

### Join into richer function metadata

```sql
SELECT g.name, f.size, f.prototype
FROM grep g
JOIN funcs f ON f.address = g.address
WHERE g.pattern = 'sub_%' AND g.kind = 'function'
ORDER BY f.size DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Parse paged JSON results from `grep()`

```sql
SELECT
    json_extract(value, '$.name') AS name,
    json_extract(value, '$.kind') AS kind,
    printf('0x%llX', json_extract(value, '$.address')) AS addr
FROM json_each(grep('init', 10, 0))
WHERE json_extract(value, '$.kind') = 'function';
```

### Pivot from discovery into xrefs

```sql
SELECT caller_name, printf('0x%X', caller_addr) AS from_addr
FROM callers
WHERE func_addr = (
    SELECT address
    FROM imports
    WHERE name = 'CreateFileW'
    ORDER BY name
    LIMIT 1
);
```

## Compare With Other Search Surfaces

- Use `grep` / `grep()` for named entities discovered by IDA.
- Use `strings` when you need literal string contents.
- Use `search_bytes()` when you need raw bytes or opcode patterns.
- Use `xrefs` after discovery when the real question is "who references this?"

---

## Failure and Recovery

- Too many hits:
  add `kind = ...`, tighten the prefix, or switch from plain text to a more specific wildcard pattern.
- No hits for an expected symbol:
  broaden the pattern, try a contains search, or pivot to `imports` if the target may only exist as an imported API.
- Need to search for comments, pseudocode text, or string contents:
  `grep` is the wrong surface; pivot to `strings`, decompiler tables, or other domain tables.
- Need bytes/opcodes:
  use `search_bytes()` instead of `grep`.
